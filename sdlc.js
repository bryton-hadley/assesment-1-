//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
/* first I will make a varible for each step by using const:
then i will be setting the  varibles equal to there defintions by using ""*/

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = " This is the second step, this step is wear you check all you steps and help you plan what you need "

const design = " this is the third step, in which the end goal is to finalize your plan and how your website will work before you put fingers on keboards  "

const implementation = " this is the fourth step, in which the in goal is to start writing code and building your project "

const testingIntegration = " this is the fith step, in which the goal is to test your code and deployed "

const maintain = "this is the sixth step, in which there are things that didnt get covered in your plan or new fetures you want to put into the site"
